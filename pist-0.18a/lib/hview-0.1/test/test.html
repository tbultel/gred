<h2><img src="images/red_ball.gif"><a name = "purpose"> Purpose of <b>TKLMITOOL</b></a> </h2>
<b>TKLMITOOL</b> solves problems such as <P>

<pre>
		minimize     f(X1,...,XM,D1,...,DN) 
		subject to   Gi(X1,...,XM,D1,...,DN)  = 0, i=1,...,p 
            		     Hj(X1,...,XM,D1,...,DN) >= 0, j=1,...,q 

where: <P>
</pre>

<ul>
<img src="images/green_ball.gif">
D1,...,DN are given real matrix variables, referred to as the
<b> data matrices</b>.
<br>
<img src="images/green_ball.gif">
X1,...,XM are real matrix variables, referred to as the <b>
unknown matrices</b>.
<br>
<img src="images/green_ball.gif">
f is a real scalar function of the entries of
X1,...,XM and D1,...,DN, linear in the X's, referred
to as the objective function (The problem is called a <b>feasibility 
problem</b> if there is no objective function specified).
<br>
<img src="images/green_ball.gif">
Gi's are matrix functions of the entries of X1,...,XM and
D1,...,DN, affine in the X's and taking real values, referred
to as the ``Linear Matrix Equalities'' (<b>LME</b>) functions. 
<br>
<img src="images/green_ball.gif">
Hj's are matrix functions of the entries of X1,...,XM and
D1,...,DN, affine in the X's and taking real values, referred
to as the ``Linear Matrix Inequalities'' (<b>LMI</b>) functions.
(Here, V >= 0 means that the matrix V is symmetric and
positive semidefinite, unless specified otherwise).
</ul>

The main purpose of <b>TKLMITOOL</b> is to help write a Matlab .m function
which admits the data matrices D1,...,DN as inputs, and has the unknown
matrices X1,...,XM as outputs.<P>

<p>
The fields above are specified using the standard Matlab syntax.
<br>

<img src="images/green_ball.gif"> A help zone : show a few lines of informations about the field where is the mouse cursor.<br>
<img src="images/green_ball.gif"> A state bar : show a line of general information about the state of the application.<br>
</ul>

Once all fields have been completed, the user may selection <b>Build file</b>  in the <b>Build</b> menu.  <P>

The user is then ready to use the matlab function created
by <b>TKLMITOOL</b>, with the syntax 

<pre><code>		[X1,...,XM,infostr] = foo(D1,...,DN)</code> </pre><P>

where infostr is a string containing convergence information.
The returned matrices X1,...XM are empty if the problem is infeasible.

<h2><img src="images/red_ball.gif">
<a name = "example"> An example : the stabilization problem</a> 
</h2>
The following problem serves as a simple example for illustrating the use of
<b>TKLMITOOL</b>. <P>

Consider the linear, time-invariant, continuous-time system in
state-space form : <P>

<pre>		dx/dt = Ax + Bu, 
</pre> <P>

where x is the state, and A is n x n and B is n x nu; both matrices
are constant. <P>

We seek a constant, state-feedback
control law u = Kx such that the closed-loop system is asymptotically
stable, that is, all eigenvalues of A+BK have negative real part. In addition,
we require that for every initial condition x(0) with ||x(0)|| <= 1, the 
resulting command input satisfies ||u(t)|| < umax for every t >= 0,
where umax is a given number. <P>

As shown in Boyd & al (1994), the above problem has a solution if
and only if the following conditions hold for some matrix unknowns
X, U : <P>
<pre>
		[X U'; U umax^2*I] &lt; 0,
		A*X+X*A+B*U+U'*B'  &lt; 0, X = X'
</pre>
<P>

The above is a simple feasibility LMI problem in variables X, U.  If it 
has a solution, then an appropriate control law is u = Kx, where K = 
U*X^{-1}. <P>

<b>TKLMITOOL</b> helps writing a matlab function, which we choose to call <tt>sf_sat</b></tt>, with syntax <P>

<pre>
		<tt> [X,U,infostr] = sf_sat(A,B,umax) </tt> <P>
</pre>

where infostr is a string containing convergence information.

We can solve this problem as follows :  
<ul>
<img src="images/green_ball.gif">
The <a href="firstdialog.html">top of the window</a> contains 3 fields that have to be completed by the user :

<p>
<ul>
<img src="images/red_ball.gif">
Problem Name : <b> sf_sat</b> 
<br>
<img src="images/red_ball.gif">
Variable List : <b> X,U </b> 
<br>
<img src="images/red_ball.gif">
Data List : <b> A,B,umax </b> 
<br>
</ul>

<p>
These inputs will ask <b>lmitool</b> to write a Matlab function with syntax
<P>

<pre>
		<tt> [X,U,infostr] = sf_sat(A,B,umax) </tt>
</pre>

that solves the problem specified by the user in
the bottom part of the window (in the above, infostr is a string 
containing convergence information). 
<br>
<img src="images/green_ball.gif">
The <b>bottom of the window</b> contains several fields, which
should too be completed by the user :
<p>
<ul>
<img src="images/red_ball.gif">
<a href="Options.html">LMI Sover Options.</a>
<br> 
<img src="images/red_ball.gif">
<a href="PrelHelp.html">Preliminary computation :</a><tt><b> [n,nu] = size(B); </b></tt>
<br> 
as the sizes of the problem (<tt>n,nu</tt>) are needed in the other
fields.
<br> 
<img src="images/red_ball.gif">
<a href="InitHelp.html">Initial guess :</a>
<pre> <b> 		Xinit = eye(n,n); 
		Uinit = zeros(n,nu);</b> </pre>
specifies correct sizes for <tt>Xinit</tt> and <tt>Uinit</tt>. <br>
Otherwise, the actual <b>value</b> of these matrices is arbitrary.
<br>
<img src="images/red_ball.gif">
<a href="LMEHelp.html">LME :</a> 
<code> <b>

<br>

<pre><code> <b>		lmi_lyap = - (A*Q+Q*A'+B*Y+Y'*B'); 
		lmi_sat = [Q Y' ; Y (umax^2)*eye(nu)] ; 
		lmi_x0 = Q - eye(n) ; 
		LMI = stack (lmi_lyap, lmi_sat, lmi_x0) ;

says that the variables X and U satisfy three inequality constraints.
<br>
<img src="images/red_ball.gif">
<a href="OBJHelp.html">Objective :</a><b> [] ;</b>
</ul>
</ul>
Once all fields have been completed, the user may selection <b>Build file</b> 
in the <b>Build</b> menu.  <P>

The function <tt>sf_sat</tt> is ready to use : within Matlab,
assuming that <tt>A,B,umax</tt> of appropriate size 
exist in the workspace, the command <P>

<pre> <code>		[X,U,infostr] = sf_sat(A,B,umax)</code> </pre>

returns <tt>X = [], U = []</tt> if the problem is infeasible, and
a solution to the problem otherwise (<tt>infostr</tt> is a string
containing convergence information, such as <tt>'optimal'</tt>).

<h2><img src="images/red_ball.gif"><a name = "howdoes"> How it works?</a> </h2>
<b>TKLMITOOL</b> invokes the Matlab function <tt>tklmitool.m</tt>. 
<br>
<tt>tklmitool</tt> generates two Matlab functions:
<ul>
<img src="images/green_ball.gif">
A <em>solver</em> function that invokes a Matlab function, 
<tt>lmisolver</tt>.
<br> 
<img src="images/green_ball.gif">
An <em>evaluation</em> function. 
</ul>
The solver and evaluation functions are created by <tt>tklmitool</tt>
from the fields of the main window filled by the user. <P> 

<tt>lmisolver</tt> calls a matlab function, <tt>lmiformat</tt>,
which puts the optimization problem into the 
<a href="standardlmip.html">standard optimization problem</a>. Then, 
<tt>lmisolver</tt> calls the optimization code <b>SP</b>.  <P>

<tt>lmiformat</tt> works
in three main steps. <P>
<ul>
<img src="images/green_ball.gif">
<em>Initial guess.</em>  A first call to the evaluation file is done,
in order to infer the number and size of the matrix
variables. 
<br>
<img src="images/green_ball.gif">
<em>Construction of LME, LMIs and objective.</em>  Making repeated calls
to the evaluation function, a representation of the problem 
is constructed, in the form of an optimization problem with linear 
objective, equality and linear matrix inequality constraints.
<br>
<img src="images/green_ball.gif">
<em>Elimination of equality constraints.</em>
Using a singular value decomposition, the equality constraints are
eliminated.  A canonical representation in the form 
of a <a href="standardlmip.html">standard optimization problem</a>
is constructed.
</ul>
