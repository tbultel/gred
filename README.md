*TCL/TK grafcet Editor*

Grafcet is a french name if a type of 'Finite State Machine'

I do not have the authorship of that (very) old and abandoned project,
so do not expect any support.

The original page for it is there: https://perso.ensta-paris.fr/~diam/gred/ with
broken links, so I wanted to push in on github, just for it not disappears forever.

It has helped me a lot in the past, to accomplish a complex project (that has been
cancelled, too) where the criterias for selecting such a tool were:

* open source and free
* light
* graphical
* description file in text format
* portable to multiple platforms

I would like to thank again the original authors for their great work.
AFAIK there is today no such modern equivalent that matches all the above criterias.
